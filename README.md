This is an going project of mine that generates audiobooks from a book input, and uses a different actors for each character in the book

The programs used are booknlp and Tortoise TTS

A working google colab demo to extract the metadata from the book needed to assign character values correctly can be found here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IKYjevl-tudqPZe-knIM9AHN2WFTTlS0?usp=sharing
