# VoxNovel

VoxNovel is an ongoing project that generates audiobooks from a book input and utilizes different actors for each character in the book. This allows for a more immersive and engaging listening experience.

## Demo

Listen to a sample of an audiobook generated with VoxNovel-Tortoise using a small passage from "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone": [Tortoise Demo MP3 file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mbv0eqcm73fzew7/test.mp3?dl=0).

Listen to a sample test file for audiobooks generated with VoxNovel using Bark TTS: [BARK Demo MP3 file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wieaq6td15v1w6t/combined-Bark.wav?dl=0).

## Getting Started

To get started with VoxNovel, follow these simple steps:

1. Use bookNLP to extract the necessary HTML metadata from your desired book/text file in a txt format. A working Google Colab demo for BookNLP_EXTRACT_DEMO can be found here: [BookNLP_EXTRACT_DEMO](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IKYjevl-tudqPZe-knIM9AHN2WFTTlS0?usp=sharing).
2. Run the BookNLP_Demo output "TTS_Input.txt" file in the VoxNovel Google Colab Demo found here: [VoxNovel tortoise Google Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iEriu4GiagSTXVua7l_nyqI9OZy4qRKA?usp=sharing).

## Additional TTS Demos

For higher quality voices, check out our Bark TTS demo (although it may have more hallucinations than Tortoise and be less easy to clone other voices). A working Google Colab demo for Bark TTS can be found here: [Bark TTS Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L0_kx6l5YoysM6MmRwPzNh78O6bNk21P?usp=sharing).

If speed is more important to you, we recommend our Coqui TTS demo, although it has more Siri-like voices. A working Google Colab demo for Coqui TTS can be found here: [Coqui TTS Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LtetgBb6vLAgV74OUxWx7cNHE0S9YpG6?usp=sharing).
