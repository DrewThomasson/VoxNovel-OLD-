Needed Files to start:
BookName.book.html -this is the html file that you get as one of the booknlp output files


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#the default input for the first thing is the alice in wonderland html booknlp output file cloned from my git repsotiory
#this will convert the output html file into the wanted matedata file 
#unfornumatly right the final output of all of this is called 5new_Wanted_output.txt
#so ill change that later

#but yeadh youll probs have to change the input directory for the RemoveUnwantedFromHTML.py file in order to use the actual output of booknlp, 
#I just thoyght that if I already laoded the output then you wouldnt haev to wait a full 83 minutes for a full book to run through booknlp to get the metadata html file :)
